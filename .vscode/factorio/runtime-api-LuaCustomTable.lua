---Lazily evaluated table. For performance reasons, we sometimes return a custom table-like type instead of a native Lua table. This custom type lazily constructs the necessary Lua wrappers of the corresponding C++ objects, therefore preventing their unnecessary construction in some cases.
---
---There are some notable consequences to the usage of a custom table type rather than the native Lua table type: Iterating a custom table is only possible using the `pairs` Lua function; `ipairs` won't work. Another key difference is that custom tables cannot be serialised into a game save file -- if saving the game would require serialisation of a custom table, an error will be displayed and the game will not be saved.

---
---### Example  
---In previous versions of Factorio, this would create a [LuaPlayer](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaPlayer.html) instance for every player in the game, even though only one such wrapper is needed. In the current version, accessing [game.players](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGameScript.html#LuaGameScript.players) by itself does not create any [LuaPlayer](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaPlayer.html) instances; they are created lazily when accessed. Therefore, this example only constructs one [LuaPlayer](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaPlayer.html) instance, no matter how many elements there are in `game.players`. 
---```
---game.players["Oxyd"].character.die()
---```
---
---### Example  
---Custom tables may be iterated using `pairs`. 
---```
---for _, p in pairs(game.players) do game.player.print(p.name); end
---```
---
---### Example  
---The following will produce no output because `ipairs` is not supported with custom tables. 
---```
---for _, p in ipairs(game.players) do game.player.print(p.name); end  -- incorrect; use pairs instead
---```
---
---### Example  
---This statement will execute successfully and `global.p` will be useable as one might expect. However, as soon as the user tries to save the game, a "LuaCustomTable cannot be serialized" error will be shown. The game will remain unsaveable so long as `global.p` refers to an instance of a custom table. 
---```
---global.p = game.players  -- This has high potential to make the game unsaveable
---```
---@class LuaCustomTable<K,V>:{[K]:V},LuaObject
---[R]  
---The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.

---@field object_name string 
---[R]  
---Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.
