---Logistic point of a particular [LuaEntity](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaEntity.html). A "Logistic point" is the name given for settings and properties used by requester, provider, and storage points in a given logistic network. These "points" don't have to be a logistic container but often are. One other entity that can own several points is the "character" character type entity.

---Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.
