---The primary interface for interacting with entities through the Lua API. Entities are everything that exists on the map except for tiles (see [LuaTile](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaTile.html)).
---
---Most functions on LuaEntity also work when the entity is contained in a ghost.

---Deactivating an entity will stop all its operations (car will stop moving, inserters will stop working, fish will stop moving etc).
